        <h1>How old are you, Thessaloniki?</h1>

                <p>
                    The devastating earthquakes that hit Turkey and Syria at the beginning of February 2023 brought back
                    to
                    the public debate the question of how safe buildings are in our country. And while experts reassure
                    the
                    public considering how strict our anti-seismic regulation is, one can easily ask: how old are the
                    buildings in Thessaloniki and what happens to those built before the first anti-seismic regulation,
                    in
                    1959?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Open data on the construction year of the city's buildings is unfortunately not available. So we
                    turned
                    to... the classifieds. By meticulously collecting over 46,114 online home sales posted between 2015
                    and
                    2019, we were able to visualize the age distribution of the city's building infrastructure through
                    the
                    corresponding mark on Google Maps.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The graph below represents the locations of the shops within the city limits with their year of
                    construction on the topographic map of Thessaloniki.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div id="svgContainer" class="svg-class"></div>
            <div>
                <p>
                    By zooming in on the years when the anti-seismic regulations were issued, both the pre-1959
                    buildings
                    and how the city eventually expanded both east and west become clearer, while the historic center
                    appears to include the oldest buildings as well.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div id="svgContainer2" class="svg-class"></div>
            <div>
                <p>
                    The next step is to map the shops on the (nearest) building blocks of general and exclusive
                    residential zones, based on the relevant topographic background of land uses of the geospatial
                    information department of the Municipality of Thessaloniki. By comparing the location of each shop
                    and the coordinates of the building blocks we can arrive at their estimated positions in the urban
                    complex.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The graph below represents the average construction age for each building block. Toumba, New
                    Switzerland, the Voulgari area, parts of the Upper Town, as well as the Kalhanokipoi include
                    residences with the most modern versions of the anti-seismic regulations.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div id="svgContainer3" class="svg-class"></div>
            <div>
                <p>
                    Extreme values in the sample can significantly affect the average value. Building blocks that
                    include few old or just a few new properties show a skewed average price. For this purpose the
                    median value can more realistically capture the age that is right in the middle of the sample. As it
                    becomes evident, in the decades of the 60s and 70s the city was built rapidly, with these buildings
                    being relatively newly built in the great Volvi earthquake of 1978.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div id="svgContainer4" class="svg-class"></div>
            <div>
                <p>
                    It's also worth looking at when the oldest structure in each building block appears and how it
                    compares to the landmark year 1959, when the country's first mandatory earthquake regulation was
                    issued. In almost every neighborhood of the Historic Center, from Lefko Pyrgos and Aristotelous to
                    Rotunda and Diokitirio, there appears to be at least one property that was built without any
                    mandatory code.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Such properties are now more than 60 years old and may either lie abandoned in narrow alleys or
                    still be used as residential or commercial premises. The behavior of these building facilities in a
                    potentially strong seismic vibration, although it cannot be easily predicted, is certainly important
                    to study in time.

                    Below is shown the age distribution in the house sales of the whole sample for the Municipality of
                    Thessaloniki, as well as for the individual districts of the city. Lefkos Pyrgos and Aristotelous
                    have some of the oldest structures and New Switzerland with Voulgari - Kifisia have the newest.

                    anti-earthquake regulations, as shown below.

                    I believe that data remains just trivial numbers and scattered letters until properly visualized to
                    tell its story. Growing up in Thessaloniki, I myself have experienced the earth shaking and
                    experienced the feeling it causes. The question of whether the buildings in my city are safe has
                    never stopped bothering me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Collecting classified ads posted online creates a data source that with proper processing - mainly
                    cleaning up irrelevant/incomplete posts and site filtering - has many stories to tell. This data is
                    available here.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Open data can capture reality better than any intermediate solution, and I hope the building
                    features of the city will become available at some point. For the graphics above, the city
                    backgrounds from SDI Thessaloniki played a key role. I hope the effort continues.
